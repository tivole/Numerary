# Numerary

Numerary is open source Scientific Library that contains many numerical methods. Numerary have been written from scratch in C++.


## Features available in Numerary

The library covers a list of topics in numerical computing. Features are available for the following areas,

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| Root-Finding    | Minimizing    | Linear Systems Of Equations     |
| Integration     | Maximizing    | Nonlinear Systems Of Equations  |
| Differentiation | Regression    | Ordinary Differential Equations |
| Gamma Functions | Interpolation |                                 |

The use of these features is described in the documentation. The documentation for each method details the algorithm, definitions and examples of their use.
