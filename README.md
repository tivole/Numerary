Integral Approximation - Simpson's Rule

### Definition
---

Suppose ![f_x](img/f_x.gif) is defined on the interval ![from_a_to_b](img/a_b.gif). Then Simpson's rule on the entire interval approximates the definite integral of ![f_x](img/f_x.gif) on the interval by the formula

The idea is that if ![f_x](img/fx_eq_1.gif), ![f_x](img/x.gif), ![f_x](img/square_x.gif), this formula is an exact equality. So Simpson's rule gives the correct integral of any quadratic function. In general, Simpson's rule approximates ![f_x](img/f_x.gif) by a parabola through the points on the graph of ![f_x](img/f_x.gif) with ![f_x](img/x.gif)-coordinates ![f_x](img/a.gif), ![f_x](img/a_plus_b_2.gif), ![f_x](img/b.gif).
