"In numerical analysis, the **secant method** is a root-finding algorithm "
"that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a "
"root of a function :math:`f`. The secant method can be thought of as a "
"finite-difference approximation of Newton's method. However, the method "
"was developed independently of Newton's method and predates it by over "
"3000 years."
