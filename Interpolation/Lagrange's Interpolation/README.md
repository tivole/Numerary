# Lagrange's Interpolation

## Lagrange polynomial

In numerical analysis, Lagrange polynomials are used for polynomial interpolation. For a given set of points ![(x_j, y_j)](img/x_j_y_j.gif) with no two ![x_j](img/x_j.gif) values equal, the Lagrange polynomial is the polynomial of lowest degree that assumes at each value ![x_j](img/x_j.gif) the corresponding value ![x_j](img/x_j.gif), so that the functions coincide at each point.
