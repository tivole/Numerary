# Secant Method

## Secant Method

In numerical analysis, the <b>secant method</b> is a root-finding algorithm that uses a succession of roots of secant lines to better approximate a root of a function ![f](img/f.gif). The secant method can be thought of as a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method. However, the method was developed independently of Newton's method and predates it by over 3000 years.

## The method

The secant method is defined by the recurrence relation

As can be seen from the recurrence relation, the secant method requires two initial values, ![x_0](img/x_0.gif) and ![x_1](img/x_1.gif), which should ideally be chosen to lie close to the root.


## Derivation of the method

Starting with initial values ![x_0](img/x_0.gif) and ![x_1](img/x_1.gif), we construct a line through the points ![(x0, f(x0))](img/x_0_f_x_0.gif) and ![(x1, f(x1))](img/x_1_f_x_1.gif), as shown in the picture above. In slopeâ€“intercept form, the equation of this line is

The root of this linear function, that is the value of x such that y = 0 is

We then use this new value of x as ![x_2](img/x_2.gif) and repeat the process, using ![x_1](img/x_1.gif) and ![x_2](img/x_2.gif) instead of ![x_0](img/x_0.gif) and ![x_1](img/x_1.gif). We continue this process, solving for ![x_3](img/x_3.gif), ![x_4](img/x_4.gif), etc., until we reach a sufficiently high level of precision (a sufficiently small difference between ![x_n](img/x_n.gif) and ![x_n-1](img/x_n-1.gif)):
