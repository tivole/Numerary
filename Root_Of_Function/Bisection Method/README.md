# Bisection Method

## Bisection method

In mathematics, the <b>bisection method</b> is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous functions for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root. It is a very simple and robust method, but it is also relatively slow. Because of this, it is often used to obtain a rough approximation to a solution which is then used as a starting point for more rapidly converging methods. The method is also called the <b>interval halving method</b>, the <b>binary search method</b>, or the <b>dichotomy method</b>.
